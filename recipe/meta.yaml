  summary: Jupyter kernels for Spyder's console

  description: |
    Provides Jupyter kernels for use with the consoles of Spyder, the
    Scientific Python Development Environment. These can launched either
    through Spyder itself or in an independent Python session, and allow for
    interactive or file-based execution of Python code in different
    environments, all inside the IDE.
    For more on Spyder, visit https://www.spyder-ide.org/

    To learn about creating, connecting and using Spyder's consoles, read:
    https://docs.spyder-ide.org/ipythonconsole.html
